# Project Rules for AI Agents
#
Notes: Project uses enode.sh to run various standalone node scripts in parent directories through electron.
such as: enode.sh fetchpatches.js mode3 -b gameid 23415 
Never run "node" for project scripts always run "enode.sh"


## File Guidelines

* Don't create extra document files for minor changes, except by appending a very brief summary to a docs/CHANGELOG.md.
* Even for major changes, also add a brief summary to docs/CHANGELOG.md
* New document files generally go in the docs or devdocs subdirectory. not the root folder.
* The docs directory is for user manuals and brief dev overview and summary information. evdocs is for more detailed developer
documentation.
* Extra documentation filenames should avoid being too much more generic than their contents - For example example FINAL_SUMMARY_GVupdates.md would be preferred instead of FINAL_SUMMARY.md   to summarize changes that are related to that one update or script.
* Scripts using database files; should have the option to use an environment variable to override the database file path, such as: PATCHBIN_DB_PATH, RHDATA_DB_PATH, or RHMD_FILE
* Scripts that edit data in a database should have a minimum of 3 test cases in the tests/ directory that verifies of each major option or parameter and uses the environment variables to select a non-production database for those test cases.  Larger scripts should have more than 3 overall.
* Scripts that accept command line parameters should have a --help command line option.
* Make sure script files intended to be invoked as interactive programs or utilities, not only as a library should be listed in docs/PROGRAMS.MD after creating or updating a script.
* Please make sure running your test cases is included by a centralized script that can run all test project cases.
* After updating code that creates or updates patchblob, attachments records, or patchblob files: make sure all related test cases in  the tests/ directory still pass.
* Serialize vue reactive objects before IPC.


## Database Schema Changes

### Schema Documentation
**REQUIRED:** All new database schema changes MUST be documented in `docs/SCHEMACHANGES.md`.

When making any schema changes (adding tables, modifying columns, adding indexes, etc.):
1. Document the change in `docs/SCHEMACHANGES.md` with:
   - Date of change
   - Description of the schema modification
   - Rationale for the change
   - Tables/columns affected
   - Any data type changes or constraints

### Database Migration Commands
**REQUIRED:** Please check and add to jsutils/migratedb.js  when creating database migrations.
All new database migration scripts or maintenance commands that the admin should run MUST be appended to `docs/DBMIGRATE.md`.

When creating migration scripts or database maintenance commands:
1. Append the command/script to `docs/DBMIGRATE.md` with:
   - Date added
   - Purpose of the migration/command
   - The actual SQL or script command
   - Prerequisites or dependencies
   - Expected outcome
   - Any warnings or important notes

### Workflow
When implementing database changes:
1. Make the schema change in the codebase
2. Document in `docs/SCHEMACHANGES.md`
3. If a migration script is needed, add it to `docs/DBMIGRATE.md`
4. Update both files in the same commit as the schema change
