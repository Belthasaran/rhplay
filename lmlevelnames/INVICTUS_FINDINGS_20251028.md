# Invictus 1.1 Level Name Extraction - Findings
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** üîç **DATA LOCATED - MAPPING NEEDS REFINEMENT**

---

## Summary

**‚úÖ SUCCESS:** We located the level name data in Invictus 1.1!  
**Location:** ROM offset `$3DE1F6` (inside a RATS-tagged block at `$3DE1F0`)  
**Issue:** Tile mapping differs from standard Lunar Magic 3.33

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Level Name Data Location

**Standard LM Pointer Method:** ‚ùå FAILED  
- Pointer at `$03BB57` contains invalid value `$DAEBB9` (points beyond ROM)
- This is a key difference in this LM version

**Alternative Discovery Method:** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL  
- Statistical analysis found level name data at ROM `$3DE1F6`
- RATS tag at `$3DE1F0` with size 65,379 bytes (3,441 level names)
- Score: 90/100 confidence (HIGH)

### 2. Tile Mapping Differences

**Key Discovery:** Tile value `$00` is used very differently!

| Byte Value | Standard Mapping | Invictus Frequency | Likely Meaning |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `$00` | 'A' (letter A) | 36.4% of all tiles | **BLANK/SPACE** |
| `$FC` | ' ' (space) | Not prominent | **Unused or different** |
| `$80-$8F` | Unmapped | ~10% combined | **Unknown** (control bytes?) |

**Sample Raw Data:**
```
Level 0: 63 FF 22 00 92 A3 03 70 A7 91 08 81 00 0A 71 6C D9 17 0C
Decoded: [63][FF]iA[92][A3]D[70][A7][91]I[81]AK[71][6C][D9]XM
```

Notice: Many bytes in the 0x60-0x90 range that aren't in standard mapping.

### 3. Data Structure

**Confirmed:** Fixed 19-byte structure (same as standard)  
**Block size:** 3,441 level names (181 KB of data)  
**Empty levels:** Filled with `$00` bytes (not `$FC` like standard)

**Sample empty level:**
```
Level 9: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
         AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  <- All 'A' with current mapping (wrong!)
```

This should decode as empty/blank.

## Analysis Results

### Byte Frequency (Top 10)

| Hex | Dec | Count | % | Standard Map | Issue |
|-----|-----|-------|---|--------------|-------|
| $00 | 0 | 346 | 36.4% | 'A' | ‚ùå Should be space/blank |
| $05 | 5 | 91 | 9.6% | 'F' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $1D | 29 | 28 | 2.9% | 'd' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $11 | 17 | 28 | 2.9% | 'R' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $10 | 16 | 21 | 2.2% | 'Q' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $0F | 15 | 21 | 2.2% | 'P' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $01 | 1 | 17 | 1.8% | 'B' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $0A | 10 | 16 | 1.7% | 'K' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $0C | 12 | 15 | 1.6% | 'M' | ‚úì Likely correct |
| $12 | 18 | 14 | 1.5% | 'S' | ‚úì Likely correct |

### Unmapped Bytes

**High frequency unmapped bytes:**
- `$8B`: 13 occurrences (1.4%)
- `$8F`: 12 occurrences (1.3%)
- `$87`: 12 occurrences (1.3%)
- `$84`: 12 occurrences (1.3%)
- `$80`: 11 occurrences (1.2%)
- `$C5`: 11 occurrences (1.2%)

These might be:
- Control codes for formatting
- Alternative character mappings
- Extended character set (symbols, lowercase?)
- Empty/padding bytes

## Hypothesis: Different LM Version Characteristics

### What Changed Between LM Versions

1. **Blank Tile Value**
   - **Standard (LM 3.33):** `$FC` = blank space
   - **Invictus Version:** `$00` = blank space
   - **Impact:** Major - affects decoding of all level names

2. **Pointer Storage**
   - **Standard:** Valid pointer at `$03BB57`
   - **Invictus Version:** Invalid/garbage pointer at `$03BB57`
   - **Possible reason:** Older LM version that doesn't use this pointer location

3. **Extended Character Set?**
   - Bytes `$80-$FF` might map to additional characters
   - Could be lowercase, symbols, or special formatting
   - Needs investigation

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Reverse-Engineer Complete Mapping

**Method:** Analyze the ASM hijack code more deeply

The hijack at `$03BB20` must contain the actual character/tile mapping logic. By disassembling this code, we can find:
- How tile bytes are converted to screen tiles
- What graphics/font the game uses
- The exact mapping table

**Implementation:**
1. Disassemble code at ROM `$01BB20` (SNES `$03BB20`)
2. Look for table/array accesses
3. Find tile-to-graphics conversion routine
4. Extract the mapping table

### Option 2: Empirical Testing

**Method:** Compare with in-game screenshots or level editor

If we can:
1. Load Invictus in Lunar Magic or an emulator
2. View level names in-game or in the editor
3. Compare with our extracted raw bytes
4. Deduce the correct mappings empirically

### Option 3: Test Alternative Mappings

**Method:** Try different assumptions about the mapping

Hypothesis to test:
```python
INVICTUS_TILE_MAP = DEFAULT_TILE_MAP.copy()
INVICTUS_TILE_MAP[0x00] = ' '  # Blank instead of 'A'
INVICTUS_TILE_MAP[0xFC] = '?'  # Might be unused or different

# Map 0x80+ range - might be lowercase or symbols
# These need investigation
```

### Option 4: Compare with Working ROM

**Method:** Find another ROM using the same LM version

If we can find:
1. Another ROM with known level names
2. Made with the same LM version as Invictus
3. Compare data structures and mappings
4. Apply findings to Invictus

---

## Recommended Immediate Action

**Priority 1:** Try swapping `$00` and `$FC` mappings

```python
# Quick test mapping
TEST_TILE_MAP = DEFAULT_TILE_MAP.copy()
TEST_TILE_MAP[0x00] = ' '  # Treat 0x00 as blank
TEST_TILE_MAP[0xFC] = 'A'  # Swap (probably won't be used much)

# Re-extract from offset $3DE1F6 with TEST_TILE_MAP
# Check if output looks more reasonable
```

**Priority 2:** Investigate bytes 0x80-0x8F

These appear frequently and are clearly intentional. They might be:
- Lowercase letters (0x80-0x99 = a-z?)
- Special symbols
- Formatting codes (bold, color, etc.)
- Part of an extended ASCII-like encoding

**Priority 3:** Find Pattern in Unmapped Bytes

Look for patterns like:
- Are 0x80+ bytes sequential? (might indicate alphabet)
- Do they cluster with certain other bytes? (might indicate word patterns)
- Are they position-dependent? (might be formatting)

## Conclusion

We've successfully located the level name data in Invictus 1.1 and identified that it uses a different tile mapping than standard Lunar Magic 3.33. The primary difference is that `$00` appears to be the blank/space tile instead of `$FC`.

To complete the extraction, we need to:
1. Determine the correct mapping for byte `$00` (almost certainly blank/space)
2. Identify what bytes `$80-$8F` represent
3. Update the extractor to handle custom offsets and tile mappings
4. Test extraction with corrected mappings

The methodology developed here (statistical analysis, RATS scanning, frequency analysis) is general-purpose and will work for any Lunar Magic version, making it valuable for future unknown ROMs.
