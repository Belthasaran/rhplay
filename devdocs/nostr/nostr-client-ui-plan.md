# Nostr Client UI Enhancements

## 1. Goals
- Surface Nostr activity in a way that complements existing Online dialogs.
- Provide intuitive discovery of external reviews, declarations, and posts without overwhelming users.
- Offer controls for managing the background service, relay health, follow lists, and Online/Offline mode selection.
- Ensure the new UI scales to future features: forums, chat, DMs, verification workflows.

## 2. Primary UI Blocks

### 2.1 Online Dialog Extensions
- **Mode selector panel** at the top: toggle between `Offline` and `Online` modes with explanatory text. First activation of Online opens a confirmation modal describing data usage and features.
- **New `Nostr` tab** alongside `Profile & Keys` and `Trust Declarations`.
- Sections:
  - `Connection Status`: list current relays, connection/latency state, last sync times.
  - `Outgoing Queue`: table of pending/published events (profiles, keypairs, ratings) with retry actions.
  - `Follow Sources`: read-only summary broken down by admin/master/user profiles, trust declarations, manual follows.
  - `Service Controls`: start/stop background service, toggle auto-start, view log snippet.
  - `Trust Assignments`: CRUD interface for viewing existing assignments, applying new trust levels/limits, and reviewing issuer scope for each entry.
  - `Insights`: surface summaries generated by CLI tools (e.g., trust inspector) with links to run detailed reports.

### 2.2 Global Activity Feed
- New sidebar drawer (accessible from main toolbar) showing:
  - Tabs for `All Activity`, `Trusted Admins`, `My Network`, `Mentions`.
  - Filter by event type (profiles, ratings, declarations, forums, chats).
  - Infinite scrolling backed by `nostr_store_in`.
- Each card uses consistent layout: avatar, canonical name, summary, timestamp, actions (view details, trust, hide, report).

### 2.3 Game-Centric View
- On game detail screen, add `Community Activity` tab with sub-tabs:
  - `Reviews`: aggregated ratings + comments pulled from incoming Nostr events.
  - `Discussions`: forum/chat posts tagged with the game ID.
  - `Trust Signals`: declarations affecting this game or related moderators.
- Provide filters (language, recency, trust level) and ability to pin authoritative posts.
- Display breakdown of ratings by trust tier (unverified / verified / trusted) with tooltips describing verification requirements.

### 2.4 Profile Activity Overlay
- When viewing another user's profile, show their published ratings, declarations, and posts (with trust indicators).
- Button to follow/unfollow (adds manual follow entry) and to open DM (future feature).
- Show verification status, trust level history, and allow staff (with scope) to open a trust assignment dialog.

### 2.5 Background Service Indicator
- System tray icon + in-app status chip showing `Offline`, `Synced`, `Syncing`, `Paused`, `Error`.
- Clicking opens condensed dashboard with relays, last processed event, queue depth, current mode, and toggle controls (including option to drop to Offline Mode).

## 3. Interaction Flows
- **Publishing flow**: After publishing (profile/rating/keys), confirmation toast with link to Outgoing Queue panel.
- **Review consumption**: Users can like, bookmark, or share reviews. Bookmarks stored locally; share produces Nostr event.
- **Trust declaration insight**: Inline highlighting when a post comes from a key covered by a trust declaration. Provide quick link to declaration detail.
- **Relay management**: Settings dialog for adding/removing relays, prioritizing relays, and enabling Tor/proxy.
- **Manual follow management**: UI to add Nostr public keys, view source of follow (manual vs derived), disable individual entries.
- **Notification system**: Desktop notifications (if enabled) for mentions, direct messages, or high-priority admin announcements.
- **Mode switching**: Central toggle accessible from Online dialog and tray indicator; entering Online prompting consent dialog, returning to Offline showing summary of pending actions.
- **Trust assignments**: Staff with permission can issue trust certificates, apply trust limits, or revoke assignments with scoped controls and confirmation prompts.
- **CLI integration**: Provide quick actions to launch `cli/trust-inspector.js` inspections or copy commands for offline analysis.
- **Scope hierarchy visibility**: Visualise section hierarchies (forums, channels, tags, gameIDs) so moderators understand which subsections are inherited from parent scopes.
- **Moderation actions**: UI should call `moderation:block-target`, `moderation:revoke-action`, and `moderation:list-actions` with actor pubkey and scoped targets, showing warnings when permission helper denies an action.

## 4. Data Presentation Guidelines
- Use badges to denote trust level (`Master Admin`, `Operating Admin`, `Authorized Admin`, `Community`).
- Show event kind and status (draft, finalized, published) when relevant.
- Provide relative timestamps with tooltip for absolute time.
- For long content (forum posts), provide expandable preview with modal for full view.

## 5. Accessibility & Localization
- Ensure keyboard navigation across new components.
- Support text scaling and high-contrast themes.
- Plan for localization of labels, tooltips, and dynamic content (dates, numbers).

## 6. Future Hooks
- Placeholder tabs for `Forums`, `Chats`, `Direct Messages` with explanatory text until features ship.
- DM composer modal leveraging planned encryption workflow (NIP-04/44) once available.
- Verification workflows for linking external identities (GitHub, web domains) using Nostr events.

## 7. Implementation Phases
1. **Foundational UI**: Online dialog `Nostr` tab, background service indicator, outgoing queue view.
2. **Activity Feeds**: Global feed drawer + game-specific community tab.
3. **Follow & Relay Controls**: Manual follow management, relay settings, notifications.
4. **Advanced Interactions**: Profile overlays, DM scaffolding, verification hooks.

## 8. Planned Extensions
- **Game/Resource Submission Modal**
  - Accessible via Manage ▸ “Game/Resource Submissions”.
  - Tabs for `My Drafts` and `Published`. Draft list shows status, last edited timestamp, moderation state.
  - “New Draft Submission” wizard capturing patch upload, screenshots, core metadata, tags, warnings, authors, submitter npub.
  - Trust gating: users below trust level 5 can draft but see warning that publishing requires an online profile with sufficient trust. Level <12 limited to one publish per 24 h (UI surfaces cooldown).
  - Moderation queue view for users with appropriate scope showing pending submissions, approve/reject controls, quality flags, reject reason entry.
- **Admin Metadata Console**
  - Shortcut for admins with metadata permissions to fast-track updates, edit read-only fields (section, combinedtype, obsoleted_by), manage patch blobs/attachments, and view publish history per game.
- **Historical Archive Management**
  - Online tab addition to list available archive bundles (`nostr-data*.json.xz`), show ingest status, allow manual rescan (arDrive folder ID, HTTPS manifest, local file import).
  - Provide progress indicators and conflict resolution summaries (e.g., “Skipped 3 older events superseded by local changes”).
- **Relay Outcome Diagnostics**
  - Extend Outgoing Queue cards to display per-relay success/failure counts, last attempt details, and retry options.
- **Submission Notifications**
  - Optional alerts when a user’s submission is approved, rejected, or requires changes, with quick links to relevant game records or moderation comments.
