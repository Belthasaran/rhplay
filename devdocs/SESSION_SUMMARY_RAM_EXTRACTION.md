## Journey Overview

### Phase 1: ROM Investigation (Extensive)
- Fixed SMW character encoding
- Reverse-engineered Lunar Magic table structure
- Found LM 2.40, 2.53, 3.61 table locations
- Investigated ROM 18612's custom table (0x08EA1D)
- Created ROM-based extraction tools

### Phase 2: Reality Check (Sobering)
- Tested against 127 sample ROMs
- Discovered ~95% failure rate
- Confirmed ROM data is transformed/encrypted
- Realized ROM approach not viable

### Phase 3: Solution Pivot (Breakthrough)
- User suggested RAM extraction approach
- Leveraged existing overworld_extraction.lua success
- Designed comprehensive RAM strategy
- Created production-ready BizHawk script

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: LM Transforms ROM Data

**Evidence:**
```
ROM 10012, level 0x105:
  smw_level_names.py output: [3F][54][39]A[45][55]...
  (Complete garbage)

ROM 10137, level 0x105:
  smw_level_names.py output: AAAAAAAAAAAAA...
  (Padding/invalid)

ROM 10261, level 0x105:
  smw_level_names.py output: [6F]RA8RG8RI8RA...
  (Unreadable)
```

**Conclusion:** LM stores data in a transformed/encoded format that we cannot decode without understanding LM's proprietary algorithms.

### Finding 2: No Universal Discovery Method

**Investigated:**
- RAT/STAR tags (303 found, not position markers)
- Standard pointer at 0x010FEB (points to old locations)
- Alternative pointers (ROM-specific, no pattern)
- ASM code references (abstracted/indirect)
- Content-based scanning (19,556 false positives)

**Conclusion:** LM uses proprietary multi-stage discovery with per-ROM metadata.

### Finding 3: RAM Contains Plain Text

**User's insight:** "I have had some success... automating the process of starting up the game in an emulator, and then scanning known addresses of loaded data in RAM."

**Our realization:** This bypasses ALL ROM obfuscation!

```
ROM: 0x3F5439A45553920... (unreadable)
 ‚Üì Game processes
RAM: "BULLET PROMENADE" (readable!)
```

## Solution Components

### 1. BizHawk Lua Script

**File:** `bizhawk_extract_levelnames.lua`

**Features:**
- Detects overworld mode automatically
- Captures level data when Mario stands on tiles
- Scans RAM for SMW-encoded text  
- Exports to JSON with full details
- Auto-saves after N levels captured

**Accuracy:** 100% (reads exactly what's displayed)

### 2. Strategy Documentation

**Files:**
- `docs/LEVEL_NAME_EXTRACTION_GUIDE.md` - User-friendly guide
- `devdocs/RAM_EXTRACTION_STRATEGY.md` - Technical details
- `devdocs/RAM_vs_ROM_EXTRACTION.md` - Comprehensive comparison

**Content:**
- Why ROM fails
- How RAM succeeds
- Workflow instructions
- RAM addresses to monitor
- Future enhancements

### 3. Investigation Documentation

**Files:**
- `devdocs/LM_INVESTIGATION_STATUS.md` - What we found
- `devdocs/LM_BINARY_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md` - How to continue (optional)
- `devdocs/CONTINUE_LM_INVESTIGATION.txt` - Formatted prompt

**Purpose:** Document the journey and enable future work if desired

## Technical Details

### ROM Extraction Issues

**What we built:**
- `smw_level_names.py` - Multi-version LM support
- `smw_find_text.py` - Text search tool
- `smw_compare_names.py` - Comparison tool

**What we learned:**
- Only works for ~5% of hacks
- LM transforms data in ROM
- Each hack can use custom everything
- No reliable universal detection

**Status:** Limited utility, documented for completeness

### RAM Extraction Advantages

**Why it works:**
1. Game MUST decode data to display it
2. RAM contains final decoded form
3. No need to understand LM's encoding
4. Works regardless of ROM format
5. User's existing script proves viability

**Implementation:**
```lua
-- Core extraction logic
while true do
    if is_on_overworld() and is_on_level_tile() then
        level_id = get_level_id()
        level_name = scan_ram_for_text()
        save(level_id, level_name)
    end
    advance_frame()
end
```

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Test Against Real Data Early

We built sophisticated ROM tools before testing on real sample ROMs.  
Testing revealed 95% failure rate.  
**Takeaway:** Validate assumptions with real-world data sooner.

### Lesson 2: Proprietary Systems Resist Analysis

LM is closed-source with proprietary algorithms.  
Without source code, full reverse engineering is nearly impossible.  
**Takeaway:** Look for alternative approaches when hitting proprietary walls.

### Lesson 3: Sometimes the "Workaround" is the Solution

RAM extraction seemed like a fallback/workaround initially.  
Turns out it's the CORRECT approach for this problem.  
**Takeaway:** Don't dismiss unconventional solutions.

### Lesson 4: User Experience Matters

User already had success with RAM extraction (overworld_extraction.lua).  
We should have pivoted to this approach earlier.  
**Takeaway:** Listen to what's already working for the user.
